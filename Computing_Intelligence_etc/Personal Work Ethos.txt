Personal Work Ethos
I believe excellence is the result of coordinated, collaborative hard work with open communication. In summary my work ethic is:
The better I get – the harder I work
If I cannot find a way – I will make the way
I can always learn while I contribute – as the team is smarter than its smartest individuals.
Thoroughness and attention to detail pave the way to perfection.
