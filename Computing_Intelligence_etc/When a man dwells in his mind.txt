When a man dwells in his mind on the object of sense, attachment to them is produced. 
From attachment springs desire and from desire comes anger.
From anger arises bewilderment, from bewilderment loss of memory; 
and from loss of memory, the destruction of intelligence 
and from the destruction of intelligence he perishes"(2.62-3)[67]
