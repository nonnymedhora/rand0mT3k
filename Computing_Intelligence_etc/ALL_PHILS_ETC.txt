When a man dwells in his mind on the object of sense, attachment to them is produced. 
From attachment springs desire and from desire comes anger.
From anger arises bewilderment, from bewilderment loss of memory; 
and from loss of memory, the destruction of intelligence 
and from the destruction of intelligence he perishes"(2.62-3)[67]

Spare me a moment to tell me what meaning life has for you, 
what keeps you going, what help—if any—religion gives you, 
what are the sources of your inspiration and your energy, 
what is the goal or motive-force of your toil, 
where you find your consolations and your happiness, 
where, in the last resort, your treasure lies. 

Write briefly if you must; write at length and at leisure if you possibly can; for every word from you will be precious to me.

Irritability, anger, hatred, and rage are forms of aversion—the unwillingness to accept what is.  
The gift of unconditional acceptance will soften your heart so that you can look into anger's true causes and conditions.
The first step to radical transformation is to let go of your judgment and hatred of your anger.

Irritability, anger, hatred, and rage are forms of aversion—the unwillingness to accept what is. 
We tend to feel that our only options with anger are to repress it or express it, yet both strategies are simply attempts to eliminate or avoid it. 
The third, more challenging way is feeling it, knowing it, opening to it. 
Your eagerness to "move past it" is actually a form of self-aggression.

What if you were to see your anger as a crying baby? Would you turn your back on it? 
Or would you approach and embrace the baby? This is what your anger needs from you. 
You say you wish to be loving, gentle, compassionate, and tolerant. Here's your opportunity! 
The gift of unconditional acceptance will soften your heart so that you can look into anger's true causes and conditions.

This process requires courage. Anger is painful. When present, it feels as if you cannot stand it—and then it gets worse. 
It feels as if it will never end. Drop your thoughts about anger and stay present with the feelings and sensations of your body
—no matter how unpleasant they may be. 
Let go of your conditioning around anger as bad, shameful, or unspiritual, and with an open, tender heart, stay with your feelings. 
Use your breath as your anchor. Anger is not monolithic but constantly changing: You will feel grief, sorrow, rage, fear, and all sorts of emotions arise, shift, and pass. 
Bringing mindfulness to anger lets you face deep-seated energies and forces that have been driving your life and keeping you from living in a fully loving and conscious way. 

This is how to transform your anger into wisdom and self-knowledge.

Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, 
Pride and most of all Wanton Sexual Lust	
In these seven deadly sins indeed indulge I must
No end in sight - no bright morrow
All I see is gloom from my lonely well of sorrow
Is any woman there to help me rise from this dust
Is there any hope to find a love I can trust
Or will endless misery rule my empty life

“Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back. 
Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, 
the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: 
that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. 
All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. 
A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner 
of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have 
dreamed would have come his way. 

Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. 
Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.”

Beauty is only skin deep. 
Sex will only blow your mind for so long. 
Money can't buy happiness. 
Remember these things before you agree to marry and 
perhaps you'll have a chance to live happily ever after,

Ujjayi is practiced with both nostrils open, when one is blocked breathe normally, the restriction of flow is enough with a closed nostril without adding Ujjayi.

    Breathe in through both nostrils*.
    Close right nostril with right thumb, breathe out through left nostril.
    Keeping the right nostril closed, breathe in through the left nostril.
    Release thumb, breathe out through both nostrils*.
    Breathe in through both nostrils*.
    Close left nostril with ring finger, breathe out through right nostril.
    Keeping the left nostril closed, breathe in through the right nostril.
    Release ring finger, breathe out through both nostrils*.

The use of Ujjayi is denoted by*.

1–8 constitutes one round and the practitioner should allow the length of the breath to be natural and not forced in any way. 
The number of rounds and the length of the breath should be kept simple and within one's own capabilities; 
count the breath length at rest and stick to that at the beginning and start with four rounds building up to twelve. 
Like all techniques, mastery comes with time and practice.

The core seven sins within purgatory correspond to a moral scheme of love perverted, 
subdivided into three groups corresponding to 
excessive love (Lust, Gluttony, Greed), 
deficient love (Sloth), 
and malicious love (Wrath, Envy, Pride).

Humility     	cures    Pride 		so be humble
Kindness    	cures    Envy 		so be kind

What I've discovered:  
- don't be a Technologist (aka. dreamer) if the company already has licenses in place or prefers to contract with typical big name providers for support
- don't be a Toolsmith if the project/company has low budget (time or money)
- don't be a Backend Warrior if the project/team/company is client-focused
- don't be a GTD if everyone else is change/risk adverse
- don't be a Front End Dev if the backend or middleware is still shaky
- don't be the Team Lead unless your project/team lacks PM or experienced devs
- don't be an Architect if the project/team already has a well-defined process and/or Business Analysts to help with requirements gathering, 
design decisions and documentation along the way

It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction
- quotes by Albert Einstein

    “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. 
	Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. 
	Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. 
	And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
	They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 
	Everything else is secondary.”

The Four Noble Truths
Main article: Four Noble Truths
The Buddha teaching the Four Noble Truths. Sanskrit manuscript. Nalanda, Bihar, India.

The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, 
and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought. 

These four truths explain the nature of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness), 
its causes, and how it can be overcome. The four truths are:[note 4]

    The truth of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness[note 5])
    The truth of the origin of dukkha
    The truth of the cessation of dukkha
    The truth of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha

The first truth explains the nature of dukkha. 
Dukkha is commonly translated as "suffering", "anxiety", "unsatisfactoriness", "unease", etc., 
and it is said to have the following three aspects:

    The obvious suffering of physical and mental illness, growing old, and dying.
    The anxiety or stress of trying to hold onto things that are constantly changing.
    A subtle dissatisfaction pervading all forms of life due to the fact
	that all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance. 
	On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never 
	measure up to our expectations or standards.

The second truth is that the origin of dukkha can be known. 
Within the context of the four noble truths, the origin of dukkha is commonly explained as craving (Pali: tanha) 
conditioned by ignorance (Pali: avijja). 
On a deeper level, the root cause of dukkha is identified as ignorance (Pali: avijja) of the true nature of things. 
The third noble truth is that the complete cessation of dukkha is possible, and the fourth noble truth identifies 
a path to this cessation.

The miracle is that the universe created a part of itself to study the rest of it, and that this part, 
in studying itself, finds the rest of the universe in its own inner realities.—John Lilly





“If a man gives no thought about what is distant,
he will find sorrow near at hand.”
Confucius



Death cannot be the enemy,
because it is part of existence.
Existence has given birth to you.
Existence is mothering you.
And when you die,
you simply go back to your original source,
to rest and to be born again.
There is no need to be afraid .
YOU will not die,
you will only disappear
like a snowflake
in the pure air.
Your form will disappear
into formlessness,
the river will disappear
into the ocean,
but it will not cease to exist.
It will even become wider,
vaster,
it becomes oceanic.

"Solitude sometimes is

Solitude sometimes is
When nothing really seems to fit..."
-Manic Street Preachers Solitude sometimes is

"I'm sixteen years old, looking at linoleum makes me think of sex"
-Xander, Buffy The Vampire Slayer.


Reduce your wants. 
Cultivate dispassion.
Be indifferent. Become a witness of your thoughts.

There is no true interpretation of anything; interpretation is a
vehicle in the service of human comprehension. The value of
interpretation is in enabling others to fruitfully think about an idea.
–Andreas Buja






The entire process may seem overwhelming; 
take it one step at a time, 
and be aware of the emotions that will come up. 

If you remember that this is a normal part of letting go, 
and remind yourself of why you decided to move on, 
it will be easier to stick to your decision, in spite of your feelings.

I pray you have the courage to let go of your past.

I pray you make room for your best life to unfold.

I pray you live a life beyond your wildest imagination.

	The first noble truth is the truth of dukkha.[note 17] 
	It gives an overview of what is regarded to be dukkha, 
	starting with samsara, the ongoing process of death and rebirth:[citation needed]

    Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, illness is dukkha, death is dukkha;
    Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, & despair are dukkha;
    Association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha;
    Not getting what is wanted is dukkha.
    In conclusion, the five clinging-aggregates are dukkha.

Being celibate simply means you are at peace with yourself and in complete control of your sexuality. 
The only reason it is still considered a sin to masturbate in Catholicism is because in the Dark Ages 
self gratification was spiritually associated with ignorance, violence and war.. 

Celibacy used to be outlawed before Christianity came about. 
It was considered a scum s life and a maggot s worth to live a life of celibacy 
which is probably what lead celibacy later on during the medieval times to have 
laws and codes regarding its safety. 

It breaks my heart to see people today still practicing these old, 
archaic forms of celibacy as their nothing more than more excuses to bondage and incendiation. 
It would have made sense to be celibate like such in the old days; but acting as such today? why? 
Especially since we know more on right and wrong now..

The Art of Knowing is Knowing what to Ignore
Never Forget WHO You ARE
Don't forget to LIVE before you DIE
Give Yourself permission to IMMEDIATELY WALK AWAY from 
	anything that gives you BAD VIBES
	There is no need to explain or make sense of it
	JUST TRUST what YOU FEEL
	
In the blink of an eye - everything can change -

Sometimes SURRENDER means giving up trying to understand

Peace comes from within - Don't seek it without		

Train yourself of letting go of everything you fear to lose.

Despite how open, peaceful and loving you attempt to be
	People can only meet you, as deeply as they've met themselves
	
	
Sometimes in remembering many sorrorws - most happiness is lost

Life is a mirror and what you see out there - you must first see inside of you

You cannot solve a problem on the same level it was created
	You have to rise above tit to the next level

 Pinker's research includes delving into human nature and what science says about it. In his interview on the Point of Inquiry podcast in 2007, he provides the following examples of what he considers defensible conclusions of what science says human nature is:

    The sexes are not statistically identical; "their interests and talents form two overlapping distributions". Any policy that wants to provide equal outcomes for both men and women will have to discriminate against one or the other.
    "Individuals differ in personality and intelligence."
    "People favor themselves and their families over an abstraction called society."
    Humans are "systematically self deceived. Each one of us thinks of ourselves as more competent and benevolent than we are."
    "People crave status and power"
