zookeeper is a  gr8 standalone distributed consensus system
good for clustered coordination system &
coordinated messaging system

operational complexity
$$$$ - costs
availability-coherence trade off
dont need distributed consensus

3 areas of evaluation
distributed consensus + coordination

environment use case
where is it running
need an ops team
cautious to add new moving parts to the env
-- all engineers will need to understand

will we be having a large# of servers running


what is it doing - use cases of zookeeper
distributed locking &
service management

dist lock
good for message queue processing
over which we have little power to control
or machines fail while processing.

all machines know who has the lock


service management / discovery
soa env
want to know whats runnning where

general registry of things


manage configuration of services of clients
dangerous though common use case

=======================
alternatives to zk

load balancing
round robin -- services are the same
can use lb instead of zk

--
dns
dist db - proven technology

open source equivalent
of google's chubby in a way
for distd locking
[ and support dns -- for dns scaling]
--
database

zk has better availabilty than db
coherence requirements
nor distd locking within a dn

service management
