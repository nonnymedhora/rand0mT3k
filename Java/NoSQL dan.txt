DEFINITION AND INTRODUCTION 
NoSQL is actually 
an acronym that expands to “Not Only SQL.” Whatever the literal meaning, NoSQL is used 
today as an umbrella term for all databases and data stores that don’t follow the popular and well-
established RDBMS principles and often relate to large data sets accessed and manipulated on a 
Web scale. This means NoSQL is not a single product or even a single technology. It represents 
a class of products and a collection of diverse, and sometimes related, concepts about data 
storage and manipulation.
