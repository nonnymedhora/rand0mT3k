Apache Kafka is a publish/subscribe messaging system designed to solve this prob-
lem. It is often described as a “distributed commit log”. A filesystem or database com-
mit log is designed to provide a durable record of all transactions so that they can be
replayed to consistently build the state of a system. Similarly, data within Kafka is
stored durably, in order, and can be read deterministically. In addition, the data can
be distributed within the system to provide additional protections against failures, as
well as significant opportunities for scaling performance.
