    2. CRUDR – read by ID
    3. Why Hibernate is so popular 1. EJB 2 sucks! + 2. New “standard”
    4. WTF #1. Nobody understand howequals and hashCode must look like
    5. Comparison context is very important Hard to select real“unique business key”Performance issues with collections Auto-generated fields in Set
    6. WTF #2. Mutable objects are evil
    7. Default constructor must present Fields can’t be finalInconsistent object state is possibleOr… reflectionmagic happens
    8. POJO bullshit game
    9. WTF #3. DTO is evil patternwith Hibernate
    10. Lots of code DTO maintenance duplications is nightmare Many solutions - transformers - beanutils - reflection - librariesCrazy DTO “don’tforget” checklist
    11. WTF #4. Lazy loading
    12. Nightmare for Everything is stupidly newcomers slow without it Almost nobody understand how it works Persistent collections are not serializable
    13. WTF #5. Criteria API or HQL =
    14. WTF!No need to know SQL Bullshit!!!
    15. Different features set in HQL and Criteria API Hand made query builders in HQL No check for NULL in HQLCriteria API only for READ
    16. WTF #6. To update single fieldyou should read full entity
    17. Children and large Not everybody fields are loadedunderstand how ‘lazy loading’ works HQL update is not object-oriented At least 2 SQL queries for simple update
    18. WTF #7. Temporary table usageon update or delete
    19. WTF #8. Composite key requiresseparate class
    20. WTF #9. Entity state can be managedonly from one side in parent-childrelationship
    21. WTF #10. Flush on commit istoo unpredictable
    22. Entity changes are persisted Collections operations are ‘live’ Constraints arechecked on commitNo control for SQL queries order
    23. WTF #11. Dirty entity aftertransaction rollback can’t be reused
    24. WTF #12. Documentation issimple but primitive
    25. Only basic samples For complex are coveredthings you need books Bug reports are ignored Debug hell tounderstand how things work
    26. WTF #13. Hibernate makesdevelopers stupid Are you joking
    27. People don’t learn JDBC and SQL Nobody countSQL queries andcare about their structure Developersdon’t tune JDBC properties
    28. When we really need to use ORM
    29. Is CQRS more actual now
    30. Useful books
