Complete FODMAP List For a Happy Gut

Ever since I posted about how a low FODMAP carbohydrate diet has been amazing for my IBS issues (major gassiness, constipation and lethargy), I've been receiving almost a new email every week from people looking for a complete list of these foods so they can implement it too.

Apparently a LOT of people have these gut issues and it's not pleasant for anyone. Since I've been sending this list out, though, there have been a lot of success stories. I personally have never been happier and no medication or therapy has ever been this beneficial for me.

These past few weeks have been really stressful for me though as I'm moving into my own bootcamp location and have been writing for more and more companies. So, I wasn't sticking to the low FODMAP food list as closely as I should have and my gut has been suffering. But, once I took the FODMAPS out, it's been much better.

In any matter - to make it easy for everyone who wants to know what to eat and not to eat, I'm posting the complete FODMAP list here for you all. Now, I want to disclaim that this is not a list intended to cure or treat every single person out there, and you still need to listen to your own body to find out what works best for you, versus someone else. You're your own best health advocate, so listen to your own gut instinct (no pun intended) :)

Here is the complete FODMAP list I've found works best for most people:
